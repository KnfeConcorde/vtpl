                                One of the pioneers of Virtual Youtubing, Eilene released a statement on twitter on 09 February 2024. 
                                She added a caption "I'm thinking of dying. I sold a certain VTUBER office "H" to a Chinese man in 2022, but this man threatened me, 
                                left me unpaid with more than 20 million yen, and forced me to pay 40 million yen." With it, 
                                two images of text was attached along with the tweet, where all of the details are found.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">私は死のうと考えています。中国籍の男性に、あるVTUBER事務所「H」を２０２２年に売却しましたが、この男性から脅迫と、２０００万以上を未払い、そして４０００万の泣き寝入りを強要されています。 <a href="https://t.co/zftLYQGwJo">pic.twitter.com/zftLYQGwJo</a></p>&mdash; エイレーン (Eilene) (@BitYoutube) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitYoutube/status/1755889735153967277?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

                                To sum it up, it all started with the creation of her VTuber agency, "H" in 2022. However, she had to sold the said company after she fell ill. 
                                The company was handed over to a Chinese man in which she named "A", who had a lot of connections and money. But the problem about this 
                                whole ordeal is that A refused to pay the livers in H. So much so as to insult the VTubers in the company. And for the past 
                                year and a half, Eilene paid the livers with her own pocket money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After two years since Eilene sold the company, he never shown any profit and loss statement to her, A stated to her that she owes her 20 million yen and starts threatening her. 
                                And due to this, she had to rely on drugs for her mental health due to stress. To add to this, she stated that whenever the drugs 
                                wear off, she has the strong urge to commit suicide. And to answer if the Japanese Authorities can help her, they stated that 
                                although there are very strong evidences agaist A, there is a chance that they couldn't arrest the man due to him living in China 
                                and the possibility of him using a proxy in Japan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To end her statement, she added that this whole ordeal is not an issue with the people of China. It does not matter 
                                where the person came from, it's just the methods and tactics were used against her. To add to that, she stated that 
                                her only regret is her family, and she hopes that there is someone to take care of them after she passes away.
