                            <p>
                                Dokibird wished her fans a prosperous new year as she celebrated for the Lunar New Year. The now-independent vtuber talked about the updates regarding her merch
                                store, her rants about the modern disney movies being formula-based, and her membership being open.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The stream also was the time that the fanbase got renamed as she and her chat had two days to rename. 
                                Back then, her fanbase name were "Bark Nights" before her return this year. 
                                She emphasized that 'Freebirds' was a no-go due to 
                                the copyright incident regarding her re-debut stream. 
                                The top choices were "Suspeks", "Nesticles", "Toribirbs", "Tomatori", and... Dragoons? 
                                In which, it won by a five percent margin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though this was a power move from Dokibird, her reasoning was that the term is based on the Mounted Infantry of the same name. 
                                She also provided us with the updated fan mascots due to her fans 'evolving.' 
                                But deep down, we all know that most of the pieces are now in place, we can safely say that we are now 'back in business.'
