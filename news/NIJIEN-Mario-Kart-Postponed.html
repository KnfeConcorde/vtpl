                            <p>NIJISANJI postpones their EN Mario Kart Special Battle on Sunday, 11 Feburary. The company announced
                                the postponement of their tournament citing "To dedicate their efforts to ensure the livers' well-being." 
                                The event was scheduled on this date initially, however they cited with the "current situation", 
                                in which the whole community took it as a reference with the Selen Tatsuki termination fiasco five days ago. 
                                The agency did not go into specifics when the reschedule date was going to take place.

                                However, the community are divided with the statements at hand, as one side are relieved that NIJISANJI are now taking steps to 
                                improve their management. While others are not buying with the "dedication of livers' well-being" and views it as an attempt of saving face 
                                in front of the community after the information about Tatsuki's suicide attempt during her time as a liver surfaced after the release of her 
                                termination announcement.
