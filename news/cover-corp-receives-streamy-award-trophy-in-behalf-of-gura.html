                                Since the conclusion of the Streamy Awards last year, COVER Corp. finally receives the award in behalf of
                                one of their member and the currently most subsribed Virtual Youtuber in the world, Gawr Gura this Wednesday, 
                                21 Feburary of this year. She was awarded in the VTuber Category on it's first iteration of the category. 
                                In a newsletter that was released by COVER, that they congratulate her with winning the Best VTuber at the Streamy Awards 
                                back in August of 2023.
                            </p>
                            <p><i>
                                "The results of the 2023 “Streamy Awards” were announced at the official ceremony held in Los Angeles, 
                                California. There, the Streamy Awards 2023 announced the five nominees for the VTuber category and 
                                Gawr Gura won the award for VTuber."
                            </i>

                                But the question that people asks is "Will Gura ever receive the trophy and not keep for COVER themselves?" The answer is 
                                yes. It is explicitly mentioned about  the award trophy being shipped to the shark girl of Hololive. Basically, the Streamer Awards 
                                ship the trophy to COVER, then the company themselves will be giving it personally to Gura.
