                                During our time here in the internet, we have seen companies fumble royally with their Public Relations, their businesses, and their desicions. 
                                And in the VTuber industry, an agency need to have to make choices. And while it can be inconsequential at best, 
                                it’s how you handle the response of the choice you make that makes all of the difference. 
                                Businesses decisions can be very damaging on a case-by-case basis, and this saga was no different. 
                                This is a tale of bad PR, a horrible response, and the backlash that came along with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the whole saga of Selen’s termination, NIJISANJI had so many opportunities to make things right. 
                                The first is how they handled the announcement. 
                                Selen was given a Zaion-styled character execution with a three page essay to justify a mundane incident of not having permissions to the cover, 
                                which in reality, the songwriter Lily Ki, did gave them permission for the cover.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And the second one was the message stream in the Elira Pendora’s channel, in which it was already dying down. 
                                Everyone wanted to move on, Selen wanted to move on. 
                                And yet, they managed to stoop so low by having a counter stream using the Livers with the most hardcore fans in the community. 
                                Ike’s Quilldren, Elira’s FamElira, and the most notorious of them all, Vox’s Kindreds. 
                                And by the looks of it, it worked. However at a cost. 
                                The whole roster unilaterally lost over 150,000 subscribers during the saga, with the most heartbreaking one being Rosemi’s 500,000 subscriber milestone being nullified.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most jarring news also came from the fact that the Leaked documents were legal’s eyes only. That means that Dokibird, 
                                Her lawyer, and Anycolor’s Legal team are only allowed to view the documents. 
                                And no one else. 
                                Just a few hours from the whole mess, Riku Tazumi, ANYCOLOR CEO has made a statement apologizing to the whole mess. 
                                But let’s face it, he was talking to his investors, not to the whole community and the brand’s actual supporters: the fans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And, the saga is still not finished ladies and gentlemen. It became so well-known in the internet that mainstream commentary youtubers, especially SomeOrdinaryGamers, MoistCr1TiKaL, and Pyrocynical have all made their cover on the whole saga. 
                                Who knows when this will end. It has been 10 days ever since the whole fiasco started, who knows when it will end.
